# CodeSandbox

This project aims to build a **CodeSandbox-like platform** where users can directly write and run code — similar to how they work in **VS Code**, but entirely in the browser.

## ✨ Vision

The goal is to eliminate the need for any installations or local setup. Users will be able to:

- Create full-fledged web applications right from the browser
- Install and manage dependencies (like `npm install`)
- Write, run, and preview their code in real-time
- Save and share projects instantly

> A truly **plug-and-code** experience — accessible anytime, anywhere.
